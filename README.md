## How to Play

- When you run the game, you will see a "GAME START" button and the game title on the screen.

- Click the "GAME START" button to begin playing the game.

- Control the snake with arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).

- Your goal is to collect the food (represented as small circles) while avoiding poison (represented as red triangles).

- As you collect food, your snake will grow in length, and your score will increase.

- The game ends when the snake collides with the game borders.

- Eating the poison will decrease your point.

- You can pause the game at any time by pressing the SPACE key.

# Game Controls

- Use the UP arrow key to move the snake up.
- Use the DOWN arrow key to move the snake down.
- Use the LEFT arrow key to move the snake left.
- Use the RIGHT arrow key to move the snake right.
- Press the SPACE key to pause or resume the game.

# Game Rules

- The snake can move through the game borders and reappear on the opposite side.

- Eating food increases your score and snake length.

- The snake's speed will increase every 5 segments.

- Poison will appear periodically, so be cautious and avoid it.

- If the snake collides with the game borders, the game ends.
